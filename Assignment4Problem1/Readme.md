Overview of your app (What is it, who is the intended audience, problem statement)

Assignment 4 Problem 1 is a Shape Hierachy app

Assignment 4 Problem 1 is a console app

Intended audiences of Problem 1 are user who would like to study simple shape hierarchy using inheritance 


Problem 1: implement a simple shape hierarchy using inheritance. 
Your program should include a base class Shape and 
four derived classes: Rectangle, Triangle, Circle and Square.

You will start the program by asking the user to determine which 
shape they would like to calculate the area and perimeter on. 
Once the user chooses the shape to calculate, then it will ask the user to enter 
the necessary variables in order to calculate the area and perimeter and then from there, 
then it will go ahead and calculate the area and the perimeter of the shape that you have chosen. 
Once that is done, then it will display the output of the area and perimeter and the 
shape that they have worked on. Your program should demonstrate the use of 
inheritance by creating objects of all derived classes, calling their member functions, 
and displaying their respective areas and perimeters.

How to run the app
First you have to compile respective .cpp source file, can be done in IDE or by following commands in console window
For Assignment 4 Problem 1 use
  g++ ShapeHierachy.cpp  -o ShapeHierachy.exe
please note here g++ is the compiler
Since apps are console apps need to start in console window by executing respective exe file
Note: app was develop by using Visual Studio Code. 

output is stored in A4P1ShapeHeOutPut.txt file.
