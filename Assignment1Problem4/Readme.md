Problem 4: Multiplication Table
Create a Multiplication Table program which will start by asking the user to enter
the starting range and the ending range of the numbers that they would like to
create a multiplication table on. From there, you will then ask the user to enter
the starting range and the ending range on the numbers that they wish to
multiply on the multiplication table. From there, you will use a conditional
statement to create a multiplication table

After generating a multiplication table, ask the user if they want to create another
multiplication table. If the user says yes, then repeat the process of creating a
multiplication table from start to finish. If the user says no, then thank the user
for using the multiplication table and then exit the program.
